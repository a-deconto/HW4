<h1>Homework 8:Intersections of waterbodies and roads in Hillsborough NC</h1>
<h2>Rose DeConto</h2>
<h3>Each point is where a road intersects with a river or stream or lake in Hillsborough and the surrounding rural areas. I used line on line overlay to get the points. I used union to tie streams and otehr hydrology together, as they were seperate files on the website I used.  </h3>
